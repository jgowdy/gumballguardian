#Gumball Guardian

Gumball Guardian is just the project name for my personal golang development efforts to create reusable methods and
types to implement capabilities in my project.

Gumball Guardian is named in honor of the Gumball Guardians who were unfortunately killed in the final episode of
Adventure Time, Come Away With Me.

This code is not guaranteed to be stable, optimal, or even correct.  This is my learning and scratch area for golang.

This code is available under the MIT license since I'm happy to share anything that has value to others.
